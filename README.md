Inventory Tracker Petite: A Simple Way to Keep Track of Inventory Items, Product Lines, and Sellers.

To use this app:

1. Clone it.

2. In your terminal, `cd` into the parent directory for Inventory Tracker Petite.  

3. In your terminal run: `rake db:migrate`

 4. Also in your terminal, run `shotgun`.

 5. Head to localhost:9393 in your browser.  Then you can create an account for yourself, create sellers, create product lines with simple description, and add inventory to those product lines.  The product line edit page allows you to note whether an item was sold and which seller sold it.

 To close out the program, close your browser, and in the terminal where you ran `shotgun`, it control+c (on a Mac).  

 To run the program again, repeat steps 2 and 4.  

 Thanks for stopping by!
